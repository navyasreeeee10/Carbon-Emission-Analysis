# Carbon-Emission-Analysis
This project analyzes vehicle transport data to estimate CO₂ emissions, identifying key factors like engine size, fuel type, and fuel consumption. The insights help track and reduce carbon footprints, supporting SDG 13: Climate Action.
# Mining Transport Data for Carbon Emissions

## Overview
This project analyzes vehicle transport data to estimate CO₂ emissions. By examining factors like engine size, fuel type, and fuel consumption, the project provides insights to track and reduce carbon footprints, supporting **SDG 13: Climate Action**.

## Dataset
The dataset is synthetically generated and contains the following columns:

- **EngineSize_L**: Engine size in liters  
- **Cylinders**: Number of engine cylinders  
- **FuelComb_Lper100km**: Fuel consumption in liters per 100 km  
- **FuelType**: Type of fuel (Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid)  
- **Transmission**: Transmission type (Automatic, Manual)  
- **CO2_g_per_km**: CO₂ emissions in grams per km  

## Features
- Distribution visualization of CO₂ emissions  
- Correlation analysis among numerical features  
- Comparison of emissions by fuel type and transmission  
- Linear regression model to predict CO₂ emissions
